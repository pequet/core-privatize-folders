*   **Author(s):** Benjamin Pequet
*   **Type:** Task
*   **Summary:** Established project definition and updated core documentation based on the initial proposal.
*   **Details:**
    *   Analyzed the proposal for `privatize-folders.sh` (`inbox/2024-07-16-0033_proposal-for-privatize-folders-script.md`) and its surrounding context.
    *   Rewrote the main `README.md` to accurately reflect the script's purpose, usage, and workflow.
    *   Updated `memory-bank/active-context.md` to set the current focus and next steps.
    *   Began the process of populating the entire `memory-bank/` with project-specific information.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   The project has a clear, documented foundation. The `README.md` and `active-context.md` are now tailored to this project, replacing the generic boilerplate content.
*   **Relevant Files/Links:**
    *   `README.md`
    *   `memory-bank/active-context.md`

    *   The next step is to review the `memory-bank/` files and customize them for this project's specific context.
*   **Outcome:**
