# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is to establish the foundational documentation for the `core-privatize-folders` project. This involves populating the Memory Bank with details derived from the project proposal to ensure a clear, shared understanding of the goals and architecture before script development begins.

## Recent Changes
- The project was initialized from the standard boilerplate.
- The `README.md` has been completely rewritten to accurately describe the purpose, functionality, and usage of the `privatize-folders.sh` script.

## Next Steps
- Sequentially update all remaining files in the `memory-bank/` directory to reflect the project's specific context.
- Once the documentation is complete, create the script file `scripts/privatize-folders.sh`.
- Begin implementing the core logic of the script, starting with argument parsing and the main function structure, using `apply-boilerplate.sh` as a reference.
