# Active Context

## Recent Changes
- The `privatize-folders.sh` script has been fully implemented with all core functionality
- Script follows project attribution and formatting standards (with minor documentation gaps identified)
- Repository readiness analysis completed, revealing need for final documentation updates and testing
- The script handles folder privatization, symlink creation, and `.gitignore` management as designed

## Next Steps
- Complete systematic review and update of all memory bank files to reflect current project state
- Complete PREFLIGHT checklist tasks
